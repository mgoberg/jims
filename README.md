# JIMS - Java Inventory Management System

JIMS, short for Java Inventory Management System, is a comprehensive inventory management application developed in Java. The system provides a user-friendly graphical interface using Java Swing, leverages Maven for project management, and stores inventory data in MongoDB for efficient and scalable data management.

## Features

- **üîê User Authentication:**
  JIMS includes a secure user authentication system, allowing businesses to control access to the inventory management system. Users can log in with their credentials to perform various inventory-related tasks.

- **üì¶ Inventory Management:**
  The core functionality of JIMS revolves around efficient inventory management. Users can add, delete, and edit inventory items through a user-friendly graphical interface. This feature streamlines the process of keeping track of product details such as name, price, description, and quantity.

- **üñ•Ô∏è Swing GUI:**
  JIMS utilizes Java Swing to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances the overall user experience. The GUI enables users to interact with the system seamlessly, making inventory management tasks intuitive and straightforward.

- **üõ†Ô∏è Maven Integration:**
  The project is structured using Maven, a powerful project management and build tool for Java applications. Maven simplifies the build process, manages dependencies, and ensures a well-organized project structure.
